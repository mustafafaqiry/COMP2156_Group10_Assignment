One of the goals of the Indigenous Initiatives team is to increase the awareness of Indigenous culture
 among the students and staff of George Brown College and the surrounding Toronto community. 
 Throughout the year, we host events, workshops and social gatherings to share our cultural knowledge.

We encourage everyone, regardless of ethnicity or religion, to come and learn with us.
