DevOps plays a crucial role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by enabling Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous
Deployment (CD), ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.
It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, promoting collaboration, automation, and monitoring throughout the SDLC.

Key DevOps practices include:
Continuous Integration (CI): Automates code integration and testing, reducing errors and improving code quality.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Ensures seamless and automated delivery of updates to production, minimizing downtime.
