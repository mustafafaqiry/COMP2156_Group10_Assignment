DevOps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
DevOps plays a vital role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by enabling Continuous Integration (CI) and
Continuous Deployment (CD), ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery. 
It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, fostering collaboration, automation, and real-time monitoring throughout 
the process.

Key DevOps Practices:
Continuous Integration (CI): Automates code integration and testing, reducing errors and improving overall code quality.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Automates the release process, ensuring seamless updates with minimal downtime.

By implementing these practices, DevOps enhances software efficiency, stability, and scalability, leading to improved 
development workflows and faster innovation.
