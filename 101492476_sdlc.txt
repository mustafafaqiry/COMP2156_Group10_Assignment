Importance of Learning DevOps in the Software Development Cycle
DevOps is essential in modern software development as it enhances collaboration, automates processes, and ensures faster, more reliable software delivery. Hereâ€™s why learning DevOps is crucial:

1. Faster Software Development & Delivery
CI/CD Pipelines automate the software build, test, and deployment processes, reducing manual effort.
Helps release software updates faster without compromising quality.
2. Improved Collaboration & Communication
Breaks the silos between development, operations, and QA teams.
Enables cross-functional teamwork, leading to more efficient problem-solving.
3. Enhanced Software Quality & Reliability
Automated testing ensures early bug detection and higher software stability.
Continuous monitoring helps identify issues before they impact users.
