George Brown College started operations on March 1, 1968. Initially there were 2,009 students and 187 instructors. The college now has approximately 30,000 students.

The college has several campuses in Toronto. I am presently attending Casa Loma Campus. The address of the campus is: 160 Kendal Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5R 1M3.

The Casa Loma Campus has a Tim Hortons inside and one outside.
